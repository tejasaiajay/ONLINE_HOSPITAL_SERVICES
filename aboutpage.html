<p class="text-justify">This project aims to introduce a Patient Scheduling Online Service for health care institutions that would ease off the appointment-scheduling journey for users and pave the path of a better doctor-patient experience. The proposed system advances with online facilities that eliminate the chaos of traditional appointment services. This system offers online appointment booking, to view doctors list, to cancel and update appointments with an administrative portal to manage all the sections. It provides advanced functionality to streamline the process thus easy access to personal hospital services that help organizations to stay connected with their customers, clients and most importantly patients and can result in significant time and monetary savings In to order to develop a successfully running online Patient Scheduling, the system is required to interact with system database, scheduling module and the administrative module for example, to achieve the best implementation, the scheduling system would be able to interact with several medical health care staff such as physicians, nurses admin staff and patients.</p>
